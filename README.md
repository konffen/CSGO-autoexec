# CSGO-autoexec
My personal settings &amp; some recommended sane defaults


### Launch Options
    -language textmodorel -tickrate 128 -novid +exec autoexec.cfg -nojoy


Required for "-language textmodorel": https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/3711

Change to -tickrate 64 if you want to practice smokes for Valve MM

Enter launch options at
`Steam > Library > Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (right-click) > Properties > Set Launch Options...`

FINALLY we can Alt+Tab fast!
`â€“ Added an optional -d3d9ex command line switch to reduce CPU memory use by about 40%.`


### Config Files

*video.txt and all .cfg files* needs to be put in `...\Steam\userdata\<Steam3 ID>\730\local\cfg`


[buyscript.cfg](buyscript.cfg)


[autoexec.cfg](autoexec.cfg) - Contains all my personal tweaks and some binds. WARNING: contains:
-CUSTOM CROSSHAIR
-CUSTOM VIEWMODEL
-CUSTOM SOUND SETTINGS FOR 4:3 FOV
-CUSTOM SCOREBOARD BIND WITH NETGRAPH TOGGLE

Remove those parts or use autoexec_stripped.cfg!


[autoexec_stripped.cfg](autoexec_stripped.cfg) - Stripped version for a more general "sane defaults"-version, rename to autoexec.cfg


[Video Settings](video.txt) - I play at 1280x960 4:3 Stretched, with "fancy" detail settings on GTX 1060



### NVIDIA Control Panel Settings

*Good luck changing these if your system language is Finnish* 

Run NVIDIA GeForce Driver Version: 441.41
Debloated by FR33THY, no GeForce Experience, no Telemetry no bullshit!

### Other tweaks?
If you are using Win 10 disable Game Bar, Xbox DVR, Focus Assist and all other annoying FPS-stealing bullshit.
Or just use https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10

#### HPET
Disable HPET in Windows! Run CMD as Admin:
bcdedit /deletevalue useplatformclock
bcdedit /set useplatformtick yes
bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes

Reboot after!

Use Intelligent standby list cleaner (ISLC) to force 0.50 ms timer:
